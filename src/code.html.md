Package for visualizing networks with a hierarchical component, such as those
generated by [cohesive blocking](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088904),
[*k*-core decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0504107), or [*k*-shell
decomposition](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/27/11150). The code implements
the algorithm described in ["Visualizing Hierarchical Social
Networks"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2378023118772982).

Relational event network models (RENM) attempt to model the flow of events
between actors in a network. These may take the form of radio calls between
emergency responders, diplomatic actions between nations, or chats between
members of a social network. These models stem from work by
[Butts](http://www.jstor.org/stable/20451153).

The code here implements a maximum likelihood estimator for a RENM in Java,
derived from the formulation by [Brandes et
al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2009.28).

[*panopy*](https://github.com/balachia/panopy) is a workflow automation wrapper
for [*pandoc*](https://pandoc.org/).

*panopy* lets you offload any number of *pandoc* workflows into a global
configuration file, letting you apply them to any file you create. Say you've
got a complex way of making your pdfs look fancy. Write a workflow template
called `fancypdf`, then call `panopy fancypdf input.md`.
